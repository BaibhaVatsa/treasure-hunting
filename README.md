# Treasure Hunting

Browser-based multiplayer game about solving puzzles in a team.

## Gameplay

### Overview

Two teams of 3 are given a series of puzzles to solve against a ticking clock. The team with the most number of credits at the end wins.

Answering correctly grants you credits which can be used by a team to either get a hint (atmost 1 per 2 questions), extend time limit by a little bit (atmost 1 per question), or life lines (atmost 1 per game).

### Phases

There are two phases to each puzzle in the game:

- Question Phase: The puzzle is presented and the teams are given a set amount of time to talk. In this phase, each team can use their credits for hints, time extensions, or life lines. To purchase any of the abilities with credits, someone must initiate a request to vote for the purchase. Aleast 2 of the 3 members have to vote positively for the purchase to be successful. After this set amount of time is over, the voting phase starts.

- Answer Phase: Each member of a team enters an answer. After everyone is done typing the answer, the typed unique answers are visible to everyone in the team. The answer with majority votes becomes the team's final answer. Depending on the answer being correct or incorrect, the team gets credits and move on.
